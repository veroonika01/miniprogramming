Java programming basics

a program called "Filter" to filter the data of a telecommunications service provider's customers. The data is stored in a CSV file.   
After applying filters, the filtered results will be displayed on the console. All customer information should be displayed neatly (using formatted output, e.g., the printf() method).
Since this is a console application, the program will be run from the command line. The first parameter (argument) will be the name of the CSV file, and the second parameter (argument) will be the filter type.

Filters consist of a single letter, cannot be combined, and may be as follows:

h — filters customers with a voice service.
i — filters customers with an internet service.
f — filters customers for billing (only clients with a negative account balance).
m — filters customers who have a mobile contact (mobile phone number must start with 09).
